This dataset is a list of all the medal winners in the Summer Olympics from 1976 Montreal to 2008 Beijing
It includes each and every medal awarded within the period.
This dataset is intended for beginners so that they can get a taste of advanced Excel
functions which is perhaps one of the key skills required to be a great data scientist. I
too got my hands dirty with the dataset and played with some advanced Excel
functions. Further, this dataset can also be used for a predictive model as to which
country is likely to fetch the highest number of gold in a particular sports category (just
an example), etc

Olympics Data Analysis Using Machine Learning
For a project based on Olympics data analysis, the primary focus will be on exploring
and understanding the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and
uncovering trends and insights related to athletes, countries, and sports over the
years.
We'll use the following columns for our analysis:

● City: The city where the Olympics took place.
● Year: The year of the Olympics.
● Sport: The sport the event is categorized under.
● Discipline: A subcategory of the sport.
● Event: The specific event within a discipline.
● Athlete: The name of the athlete who participated.
● Gender: The gender of the athlete.
● Country_Code: The country code (abbreviation).
● Country: The full name of the country.
● Event_gender: The gender category of the event.
● Medal: The medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
Objective
The primary goal is to:1. Analyze the dataset to understand trends in medal distribution.
2. Identify the top-performing countries and athletes.
3. Study the gender distribution of events and medals.
4. Visualize the data using Python.
